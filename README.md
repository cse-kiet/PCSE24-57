# 5.How to execute the code (Instructions)

* You must have **Python3.8** installed in your machine.
* Create a Python Virtual Environment & Activate Virtual Environment [Link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
* Install all the dependencies using below command
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Go to the `Flask Deployed App` folder.
*  Download the pre-trained model file `plant_disease_model_1.pt` from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ewJWAiduGuld_9oGSrTuLumg9y62qS6A?usp=share_link)
* Add the downloaded file in `Flask Deployed App` folder.
* Run the Flask app using below command `python3 app.py`
* You can also use downloaded file in `Model` Section and play with it using Jupyter Notebook.

* ‚≠êTesting Images

* If you do not have leaf images then you can use test images located in test_images folder
* Each image has its corresponding disease name, so you can verify whether the model is working perfectly or not



# 6.Project Requirements for execution

##### Your "plant_disease_model_1_latest.pt" should be in this folder. You have to trained that model in your pc/laptop and drag it to this folder

##### First check the Model section of this Repo. After that you can understand deployed app.

##### Make sure if you change the model name then also change the name of the model argument in the app.py

#### You have to Installed all the requirments. Save all the below requirements in requirements.txt
#### Run this line in cmd/shell :  pip install -r requirements.txt
